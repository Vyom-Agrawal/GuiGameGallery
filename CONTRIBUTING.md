# 🚀 Contributing to GuiGameGallery

We welcome your ideas, creativity, and expertise in making this collection of unique Python Tkinter mini games even more fun and innovative.

## 🏆 What Makes a Great Contribution?

- **Uniqueness:**
  Please only submit mini games that introduce new mechanics, experimental ideas, or creative challenges not commonly found in existing open source Python/Tkinter repositories. Think beyond the classics!

- **Quality & Learning:**  
  Write clear, beginner-friendly code. We value readable, well-documented, and modular projects to help learners and encourage remixing.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository.**
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vyom-Agrawal/GuiGameGallery.git
   cd GuiGameGallery
   ```

3. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

## 🎮 Game Folder Structure

For a new game, create a subfolder in `/games/`:
```
/games/
├── /your-unique-game/
│   ├── main.py       # Game entry point (should be runnable)
│   ├── README.md     # Gameplay and controls description
│   └── assets/       # (Optional) Images, audio, GIFs, etc.
```

- `main.py`: The main file to run your game.
- `README.md`: Explain how your game is played, its unique aspects, and credits.
- `assets/`: Place all media or external files here.

---

## ✨ Coding Guidelines

- Requires **Python 3.7+**
- Use **Tkinter** for the GUI. Other lightweight libs (for sound, etc.) may be justified—document clearly.
- Follow **PEP8** for code style.
- Keep it modular, readable, and add docstrings/comments for clarity.
- Avoid duplicating games/ideas already present in this or other popular repositories.
